//Deoderant Evaporator:
https://www.codewars.com/kata/5506b230a11c0aeab3000c1f


//Problem
his program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas.

We know the content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas lost every day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage beyond which the evaporator is no longer useful. All numbers are strictly positive.

The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the evaporator will be out of use.

Note : Content is in fact not necessary in the body of the function "evaporator", you can use it or not use it, as you wish. Some people might prefer to reason with content, some other with percentages only. It's up to you but you must keep it as a parameter because the tests have it as an argument.


//My Solution
function evaporator(content, evap_per_day, threshold){ 
  var n = 0;
  //Initialising a counter for the number of viable days
  var threshNumber = content * (threshold/100)
  //establishing the limit for the content before it becomes unusable
  while (content > threshNumber) {
    content = content - (content * (evap_per_day/100));
    n++;
  }
  return n;
}


//Working
I created a counter n, to represet the number of viable days. I then created a while loop that would continue as long as the content didn't drop below the threshould (all the while, increasing n by 1 for each loop.
My formula within the while loop is reducing content by the percentage that evaporated.
Once the content was reduced to below the threshold, n was an accurate representation of the number of viable days which I then returned.

//Regex Password Validation:
https://www.codewars.com/kata/regex-password-validation


//Problem
You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

At least six characters long
contains a lowercase letter
contains an uppercase letter
contains a number
Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.


//My Solution
function validate(password) {
  console.log(password);
  return /(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.{6,})/.test(password);
}


//Working
Currently this solution works for all but 2 tests. The (?=.* expression) is to emulate an AND in the regex and apply multiple validations.

The two that are currently passing incorrectly are:
fjd3IR9.;
fjd3  IR9
